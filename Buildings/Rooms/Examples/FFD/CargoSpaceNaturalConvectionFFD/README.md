Dear all, 
As some of you know, I'm a true Modelica beginner, hoping to use Building's FFD in order to simulate a convective behavior.
After checking the "cargo_space_ffd" document, which describes my case, if anyone can help me with the following, I would be very pleased:
- does it look possible?
- how would you begin? sorry, I'm a beginner.
Thanks for reading!
LÃ©onard
